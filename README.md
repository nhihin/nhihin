### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing analysis and exploratory workflows for single-cell transcriptomic data.
- 🌱 Obsessed with organising/optimising my life and projects through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 
- 👩🏻‍🎓 I completed my PhD in 2020 at The University of Adelaide on the [Alzheimer's disease transcriptome](https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/129610), graduating as a recipient of the [university medal](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/graduatecentre/current-students/your-thesis-examination/research-student-excellence-awards#2020) and [Mace Bearer](https://twitter.com/StevePederson8/status/1382691431186374664). 
- 📖 Research Highlight: I developed a workflow to investigate [iron homeostasis using IREs in transcriptome data in Alzheimer's disease](https://twitter.com/NhiHin/status/1443376890782175237) which won the best poster award at [AMSI BioInfoSummer](https://amsi.org.au/2020/05/04/nhi-hin-research-pre-release-iron-responsive-element-ire-mediated-responses-to-iron-dyshomeostasis-in-alzheimers-disease/) and best student presentation award at  [GIW-](https://twitter.com/frostickle/status/1204622505454866432?s=20&t=DFx6Cu3tY7g5fZxZ03JSDA)[ABACBS](https://twitter.com/methylnick/status/1204623317031776256).
